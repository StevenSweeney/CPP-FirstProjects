#My first projects using C++

These are the first projects I made learning C++ that I dumped into here for safekeeping.

***BuzzFizz.cpp: This is program that prints 100 numbers. If it's divisible by 3, it doesn't print the number, but it prints "Fizz". If it's divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz". But if it is divisible by both 3 and 5 (15), then it will print "FizzBuzz".

***DogYearsToHumanYearsCalculator.cpp: This converts dog years to human years, simple.

If the dog is under 2 years old, it will multiply 10.5 by how old the dog is. So if your dog was 18 months old, it would be 10.5*1.5 which would be 15.75 years old in human years.

If the dog is over 2 years, it will first start by adding 21, because the first 2 years of a dogs life is equivalent to 21 human years. Then each year after that will be 4 years. So it will look like this:
If y is human years converted, and x is dog years:
y = 21 + ( ( x - 2 ) * 4 )

***Quadratics.cpp: gets the x intercepts of a quadratic.

***RPS.cpp: Rock, paper, scissors

***TheSortingHatQuiz.cpp: Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz to see what you are

***TheWoods.cpp: mini adventure game
